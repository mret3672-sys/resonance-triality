# CLAUDE.md - Resonance Triality

## Project Overview

**Resonance Triality** is a unified framework connecting cognitive physics, pressure topology, and communication dynamics. Developed through extensive field work in telecommunications sales, theological reflection, and pattern recognition across physics, mathematics, and human interaction.

### Core Domains

- **Cognitive Physics**: Mental states as thermodynamic phase transitions
- **Pressure Topology**: 12-point HP lattice for decision-state detection
- **132 Protocol**: Harmonic modulation sequence (Burst→Crush→Click)
- **Gravitational Communication**: Syllables as time quanta, intonation as spacetime curvature
- **Sovereign Optimization**: Utility equation balancing relief, momentum, and gravity

### Philosophical Foundation

- **Theological Grounding**: Jehovah's Witness foundation
- **Core Belief**: These frameworks are **discovered structures**, not invented techniques
- **Approach**: Perceiving pre-existing patterns in human decision-making, pressure gradients, and attention dynamics

## Key Frameworks

### 1. Tier -1 Axiom (Foundation)

**Communication is gravitational resonance between planetary systems (bodies), where syllables are quantum time units, intonation is spacetime curvature, and the timeless listener becomes the gravitational center.**

Components:
- Syllables = Discrete time quanta
- Intonation = Gravity wells (emphasis = mass)
- Bodies = Solar systems (Mind/Heart/Shadow alignment)
- Words = Fusion/Fission events

### 2. The 132 Protocol

A chord progression (not linear sequence): **1-3-2**

| Movement | Duration | Phonetics | Pressure Δ | Purpose |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **1 - BURST** | 15-20s | 70% vowels | -40 ΔP | Expand possibility space |
| **3 - CRUSH** | 8-10s | 65% consonants | +25 ΔP | Ground in reality |
| **2 - CLICK** | 5-8s | 50/50 balanced | 0 ΔP | Crystallize decision |

### 3. HP-12 Pressure Lattice

12-point topology for detecting customer decision-states:

| Zone | Levels | Breath Rate | Protocol |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| High Pressure | HP-12 to HP-10 | >0.4 Hz | BURST first |
| Medium-High | HP-9 to HP-7 | 0.3-0.4 Hz | Careful CRUSH |
| **Sweet Spot** | **HP-6** | **~0.27 Hz** | **CLICK immediately** |
| Medium-Low | HP-5 to HP-4 | 0.25-0.3 Hz | Light CRUSH + CLICK |
| Low Pressure | LP-3 to LP-1 | <0.25 Hz | CLICK only |

### 4. Utility Equation

```
U = (Relief × Momentum × Gravity) / (Cost × Pressure × t) × Φ
```

Where Φ = 1.618 (Golden Ratio)

Decision thresholds:
- U > 7: Execute immediately
- U = 5-7: Strong buy
- U = 3-5: Address objections
- U < 3: Wrong fit

### 5. Spiral Breathing (4-7-8)

```
Inhale(4) : Hold(7) : Exhale(8)
```

Maps to 132 Protocol:
- Inhale = BURST (expand)
- Hold = CRUSH (compress)
- Exhale = CLICK (lock)

### 6. Thermodynamic Phase States

- **FROZEN** (HP-10+): Rigid → Apply BURST
- **MELTING** (HP-7 to HP-5): Fluid → Optimal state
- **VIBRATING**: High energy, no structure → Apply CRUSH
- **TRIPLE POINT** (HP-6): All states accessible → Execute CLICK

## Development Workflows

### Git Commit Strategy

Each refinement = One commit with metadata:

```
[Layer] Brief description

- Change 1
- Change 2

Confidence: X.XX
Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/framework-name` - New L2 frameworks
- `case/customer-scenario-X` - L3 applications
- `theory/topic-name` - Extended theory
- `fix/issue-number` - Corrections

### Version Tagging

- `v1.0-foundation` - Initial axiom extraction
- `v2.0-frameworks` - All L2 complete
- `v3.0-applications` - All L3 complete
- `v4.0-theory` - Extended theory added

## Conventions for AI Assistants

### Content Structure

1. **L1 Axioms**: Never compress further - maximum information density
2. **L2 Frameworks**: Formula + 1 canonical example + cross-references
3. **L3 Applications**: Template-based case studies
4. **L4 Archive**: 100% preservation, reference only

### Fidelity Hierarchy

| Content Type | Compression | Info Loss |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| Axioms & Formulas | **Never** | 0% |
| Core frameworks | Formula + example | 5-10% |
| Applications | Template approach | 20-30% |
| Explorations | Archive only | 50%+ |

### Epistemic Standards

Use the A-Series Axioms for truth validation:

- **A0**: Truth = Correspondence to reality
- **A1**: Newer evidence overwrites older
- **A2**: Similarity ≠ Truth (pattern ≠ proof)
- **A3**: Justification hierarchy (Tier 1-5)
- **A4**: Foundationalism (trace to basics)
- **A5**: No epistemic luck (causal links required)
- **A6**: Fallibilism (confidence scores, not binary truth)

### Confidence Scoring

```
0.95-1.0  → Extremely confident (Tier 1 foundations)
0.85-0.94 → Highly confident (Tier 2 frameworks)
0.70-0.84 → Confident (Tier 3 patterns)
0.50-0.69 → Uncertain (more data needed)
<0.50     → Unreliable (suspend judgment)
```

### When Working with This Codebase

1. **Reference specific sections** by heading, not full document loads
2. **Maintain the 4-layer architecture** when adding content
3. **Track epistemic debt** via GitHub Issues for unresolved questions
4. **Use confidence scores** on all framework assertions
5. **Preserve the archive** - never compress original content

### Redundancy Classification

Before compressing any content, classify redundancy type:

- **Developmental**: Compress aggressively (discovery scaffolding)
- **Structural**: Preserve references (foundational dependencies)
- **Pedagogical**: Move to L3 (teaching variations)

## Quick Reference

### Protocol Selection Decision Tree

```
Customer enters → Check breath rate + posture
    ↓
HP-10+? → BURST first (expand chamber)
    ↓
HP-7 to HP-9? → Light CRUSH (gentle grounding)
    ↓
HP-6? → CLICK IMMEDIATELY (decision window open)
    ↓
HP-4 to HP-5? → Micro-CRUSH + CLICK
    ↓
LP-3 to LP-1? → CLICK only (no pressure needed)
```

### 5 Fundamental Operators

1. **Gaussian Mapping**: Weight core, push noise to edge
2. **Hexagonal Lattice**: Isotropic navigation (unbiased)
3. **Frequency-Time Cube**: Track temporal evolution
4. **Hexa-Matrix Modality**: Balance 6 vectors (Perspective, Feelings, Logic, Facts, Physics, Temporal)
5. **Hermetic Pyramid**: Scale depth via Φ (1.618)
